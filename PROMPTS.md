Create a custome status line for me please.  I would like it to be similar to trueline.  Primarily I'd like it to display my usage quotas for the session, week, and sonnet only bars.

Let's add git branch issue and some spacing between the segments.

Add the session reset time to the bar

---

## 2026-01-10 12:48:57

on the claude.ai/settings/usage page it shows my current session time and when the session resets.  Is it possible to display this on the status line

Let's make a notes about the idea of #2 so I can come back to it but do not implement right now.

what's the best way to check a .claude directory into a git repo?  It seems like there are a lot of files for projects and cache data.  Can you recommend a .gitignore that would just capture the global settings and not the rest.

git status

---

## 2026-01-10 13:21:00

Can we make it so the statusline stats for usage, tokens, cost, and time are tracked for project instead of session.

create a README.md describing the files in the git respository

---

Tell me what other information you can get from the json file during claude processing that might be interesting for the status bar.  Also add a 'current time' segment on the far right.

## 2026-01-10 13:32:02

Add the context headroom segment

---

## 2026-01-10 13:33:53

Replace the current Ctx stat with context headroom in a percentage.  Make the bar decrease based on usage.  Also double the length of the bar on the statusline.
